        A little paragraph about myself and snowboarding:
    </h2>
    <p>
        Hi! My name is Leon Li. I'm a first year student at BCIT studying Computer information systems. 
        My favourite sport is badminton, but I'm also an avid snowboarder as well. This year, I'm planning 
        to snowboard a lot. And I mean <strong>A lot</strong>. Since BCIT gives us students a generous four 
        week winter break, my plan to go every day is now within reach! Alright, going <em> everyday</em> is
        a stretch, but if I could, I would. That's just how much I enjoy snowboarding!
